        "\n",
        "This repository implements Hackathon II: The Evolution of Todo using Spec-Driven Development and AI-Native Architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system evolves from a simple in-memory CLI to a cloud-native, event-driven, AI-powered Todo platform, without manual coding.\n",
        "The engineer’s role is system architect, not syntax writer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Golden Rule:\n",
        "❌ No handwritten application code\n",
        "✅ All code is generated via Claude Code from validated specs\n",

        "2. Core Principles\n",
        "\n",
        "Spec is the Source of Truth\n",

        "3. Development Constraints (Non-Negotiable)\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ Manual code writing is forbidden\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ Ad-hoc changes outside specs are forbidden\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Specs must be refined until Claude Code produces correct output\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Every feature must have a corresponding spec\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Generated code must match the spec exactly\n",
